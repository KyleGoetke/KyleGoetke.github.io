                        <p>I am a member of the New Providence High School Marching Band. As a freshman, I was a member
                        of the Pit. As a sophomore, junior, and senior, I played the Bass Drum. My freshman,
                        junior, and senior years, the band received awards for being both State and National Champions.</p>

                        <p class="title">Boy Scouts</p>
                        <p>I am an Eagle Scout and an active leader in my troop. I have served as a
                        Senior Patrol Leader, and current serve as a Junior Assistant Scoutmaster. As an SPL, I led and planned
                        troop meetings, campouts, and other activities. As a JASM, I instruct younger scouts in the troop
                        and supported the troop's adult leadership.</p>

                        <p>I volunteered in Virginia and West Virgina with the Appalachia Service Project to
                        repair homes and improve living conditions for low-income families. ASP has been helping
                        communities in central Appalachia for the past 50 years, and being a part of it was a
                        challenging but fulfilling experience. My team and I worked closely with the homeowners to
                        give them the best possible results in a limited timeframe. While the work was difficult, it
                        was an incredible, life-changing experience.</p>
