                        <p>I am a member of the New Providence High School Marching Band. As a freshman, I was a member
                        of the Pit. As a sophomore, junior, and senior, I played the Bass Drum. My freshman and
                        junior years, the band received awards for being State and National Champions.</p>

                        <p>I am a Life Scout, and am awaiting my Eagle Scout Board of Review. I have served as both a
                        Senior Patrol Leader (SPL) and Assistant Senior Patrol Leader (ASPL). The SPL is the
                        highest-ranking youth leader in the troop and leads the troop meetings, troop campouts, and
                        other troop activities.</p>

                        <p>I volunteered in Virginia and West Virgina with the Appalachia Service Project to
                        repair homes and improve living conditions for low-income families. ASP has been helping
                        communities in central Appalachia for the past 50 years, and being a part of it was a
                        challenging but fulfilling experience. My team and I worked closely with the homeowners to
                        give them the best possible results in a limited timeframe. While the work was difficult, it
                        was an incredible, life-changing experience.</p>
